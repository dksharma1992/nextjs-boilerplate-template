This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

.nvmrc - Will tell uses of the project which version of Node is used

.npmrc - Will tell users of the project which package manager is used

The .prettierrc file will contain all the Prettier rules that you are introducing in the project. The following code demonstrates a few rules you can add as JSON key-value pairs

The .prettierignore file will contain the names of those files and folders that you do not want Prettier to run and analyze. For example, you would never want to run Prettier on the node_modules folder, dist folder, package.json, and other such files. Therefore, add paths to these files in .prettierignore like so:

A new webpage should open at http://localhost:6006, and you should see something like this:
